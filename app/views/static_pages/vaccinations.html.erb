  <h1>Vaccinations</h1>
  <p>Our schedule of vaccinations is based on the Ontario Government's reccomendations, but you are also able to track
  non-routine inoculations as well.</p>
  <h3>Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Acellular Pertusis vaccin - Inactivated Polio Vaccine</h3>
  <p>Abbreviated as "DTaP-IPV", this vaccine is a combination that protects against four different disease. It is required
  by law for all children attending school in Ontario and is recommended for infants and children less than seven years
  of age
  </p>
  <p>Diphtheria, a disease of the throat, nose, and skin, is passed on by coughing and sneezing. Typical symptoms include
  fever, chills, and a sore throat. Despite medical advances, it kills about 1 out of every ten who contract the disease
  and treatment can be complicated by breathing problems, heart failure and nerve damage. Fortunately, thanks to widespread
  vaccination efforts, the last case of diphtheria in Ontario was in 1995, but that does not mean it is safe to stop
  inoculating our children.
  </p>
  <p>Tetanus, colloquially known as 'lockjaw' is another serious disease that is generally caused by contamination of open
  wounds by germ-containing dirt. Children are at higher risk because they are more likely to cut themselves while playing
  on the playground or in the park, exposing themselves to Tetanus germs found in soil, dust, and manure. However, Tetanus
  is not spread between humans. The disease is associated with muscle cramping and painful convulsions that can be violent
  enough to damage skeltal structures. Even if found and treated early, Tetanus has mortality rates as high as 20%.
  </p>
  <p>
  Pertusis, bettern known as whooping cough, is a disease spread through coughing and sneezing that causes violent coughing
  and can be very threatening for children as it can cause vomitting and inhibit breathing. Typical infections last for 
  multiple weeks and are associated with serious complications in a significant fraction of cases. The worst outcomes include
  onset of pneumonia, brain damage, seizures, and death. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Polio is a very potent disease that causes nerve damage and paralysis, including paralysis of muscles required for eating,
  mobility, and even breathing. In some cases, it can be lethal. Although many victims will fully recover muscle function, not
  all do and recovery can take many years. It is spread through infected feces entering the mouth which can occur by contamination
  of food and water. Despite the Americas being declared polio-free in 1994, it is important to keep your children protected 
  from this disease.
  </p>
  <h3>Measles, Mumps, Rubella</h3>
  <p>The MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) vaccine is another combination treatment that provides immunity from three separate 
  diseases and is typically given after a child's first birthday and again at 4-6 years of age. Furthermore, in Ontario children
  entering public school are required by law to be immunized against measles, mumps and rubella.
  </p>
  <p>
  Measles causes several unpleasant symptoms including coughing, rashes, feverish temperatures, and a runny nose. The infection 
  typically lasts for one to two weeks during which the disease can be spread to others by coughing and sneezing around them. Even
  the aerosols created by talking can be sufficient for transmission. Complications include lung and ear infections in roughly 10%
  of cases and infection of the brain in a much smaller portion. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Mumps is passed in a similar manner to measles, through coughing, sneezing, and even talking. This makes children in communal
  situations like schools and daycares susceptible to the viral infection. Common effects include headache, swelling of the neck,
  jaw, and cheek, and fever. Meningitis, inflamation of the brain's surrounding membrane, is a very serious complication that can
  result from the disease.
  </p>
  <p>
  Rubella, sometimes called German measles, is generally mild in severity for children causing a sore throat, rashes on the face 
  or neck, and swollen glands in the neck. In older adolescents and adults the disease manifests itself in aches and pains which can
  be followed by chronic arthritis. The disease is most dangerous for pregnant women in whom Rubella will likely cause congenital 
  rubella syndrome severly disabling or killing the unborn baby. It, too, is spread similarly to measles through coughing, sneezing,
  and talking.
